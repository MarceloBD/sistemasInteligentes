Abstract
Case-based
classification
powerful
classification
method
which
simplest
form
assigns
target
case
same
class
nearest
previously
classified
cases
Many
case-based
classifiers
simple
nearest-neighbour
technique
identify
nearest
case
this
means
comparing
target
case
stored
cases
classification
time
resulting
high
classification
costs
this
reason
many
techniques
have
been
proposed
improve
performance
case-based
classifiers
reducing
search
they
must
perform
this
paper
will
look
editing
techniques
that
preserve
lazy-learning
quality
case-based
classification
improve
classification
performance
