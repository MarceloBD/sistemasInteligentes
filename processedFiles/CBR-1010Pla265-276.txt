language
multistrategy
leaming
advantage
using
structured
representations
twofold
Firstly
offers
natural
describe
composite
objects
that
described
attribute-value
representations
cause
some
problems
like
dealing
with
irrelevant
attributes
not-applicable
values
this
leads
problems
when
comparing
similitude
among
cases
this
descriptions
Secondly
structured
representation
cases
offer
capability
treating
subparts
cases
also
full-fledged
cases
they
stored
retrieved
used
solve
sub)problems
cases
also
case
solved
using
subparts
multiple
cases
retneved
from
system’s
memory
will
present
here
formalization
structured
sometimes
called
object-centered
representations
feature
terms
will
present
assess
similarity
between
feature
terms
cases
determine
preferred
most
similar
case
from
cases
