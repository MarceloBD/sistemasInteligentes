advantage
using
structured
representations
twofold
firstly
offers
natural
describe
composite
objects
that
described
attribute
value
representations
cause
some
problems
like
dealing
with
irrelevant
attributes
applicable
values
this
leads
problems
when
comparing
similitude
among
cases
this
descriptions
secondly
structured
representation
cases
offer
capability
treating
