Abstract
Realistic
complex
planning
situations
require
mixed-initiative
planning
framework
which
human
automated
planners
interact
mutually
construct
desired
plan
Ideally
this
joint
cooperation
potential
achieving
better
plans
than
either
human
machine
create
alone
Human
planners
often
take
case-based
approach
planning
relying
their
past
experience
planning
retrieving
adapting
past
planning
cases
Planning
analogical
reasoning
which
generative
case-based
planning
combined
Prodigy/Analogy
provides
suitable
framework
study
this
mixed-initiative
integration
However
having
human
user
engaged
this
planning
loop
creates
variety
research
questions
challenges
found
creating
mixed-initiative
planning
system
fall
into
three
categories
planning
paradigms
differ
human
machine
planning
visualization
plan
planning
process
complex
necessary
task
human
users
range
across

with
respect
planning
domaln

This
paper
presents
approach
these
three
problems
when
designing
interface
incorporate
human
into
process
planning
analogical
reasoning
with
Prodigy/Analogy
interface
