abstract
divide
conquer
separate
conquer
strategies
rule
induction
that
have
been
used
extensively
when
searching
rules
maximally
conservative
decisions
made
during
search
previous
rules
this
results
very
efficient
strategy
which
however
suffers
from
difficulties
effectively
inducing
disjunctive
concepts
replication
problem
other
hand
maximally
liberal
same
respect
this
allows
larger
hypothesis
space
searched
which
many
cases
avoids
replication
problem
cost
lower
efficiency
present
hybrid
strategy
called
reconsider
conquer
which
handles
replication
problem
more
effectively
than
reconsidering
some
earlier
decisions
allows
more
efficient
induction
than
holding
some
decisions
present
experimental
results
from
propositional
numerical
relational
domains
demonstrating
that
significantly
reduces
replication
problem
from
which
suffers
several
times
order
magnitude
faster
