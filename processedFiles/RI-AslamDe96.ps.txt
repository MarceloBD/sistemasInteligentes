Abstract
this
paper
further
characterize

Specifically
show

Combined
with
result
Simon
e#ectively
show
that
sample
complexity

Furthermore
demonstrate
optimality
general
lower
bound
providing
noise­tolerant
learning
algorithm
class

Boolean
functions
which
uses

bound
Finally
note
that
general
lower
bound
compares
favorably
with
various
