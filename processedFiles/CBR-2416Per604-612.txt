Abstract
development
automatic
image
classification
system
hard
problem
since
such
system
must
imitate
visual
strategy
human
expert
when
interpreting
particular
image
Usually
easy
make
this
strategy
explicit
Rather
than
describing
visual
strategy
image
features
human
able
judge
similarity
between
objects
This
judgement
basis
guideline
development
process
This
guideline
help
developer
understand
what
kind
case
description/features
necessary
sufficient
system
performance
give
idea
what
system
performance
achieved
paper

Based
similarity
between
objects
system
developer
provide
image
features
improve
system
performance
until
system
performance
reached
that
