this
paper
discusses
online
poweraware
routing
large
wireless
adhoc
networks
applications
where
message

network
show
that
online
poweraware
routing
does
have
constant
competitive
ratio
offline
optimal
algorithm
develop
approximation
algorithm
called
maxmin
zpmin
that
good
empirical
competitive
ratio
ensure
scalability
introduce
second

algo
rithm
poweraware
routing
this
hierarchical
algorithm
called
