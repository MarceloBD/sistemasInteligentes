Abstract
this
paper
propose
thorough
investigation
nearest
neighbor
rule
wbich
call
“Symmetric
Nearest
Neighbor
rule”
Basically
symmetrises
classical
nearest
neighbor
relationship
from
which
computed
points
voting
some
instance
Experiments
datasets
most
which
readily
available
show
that
method
significantly
outperforms
traditional
Nearest
Neighbors
methods
Experiments
domain
interest
related
tropical
pollution
normalization
also
show
greater
potential
this
method
finally
discuss
reasons
mule’s
efficiency
provide
methods
speeding-up
classification
time
derive
from
rule
reliable
fast
algorithm
parameter
k-NN
rule
longstanding
