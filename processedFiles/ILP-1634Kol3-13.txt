Abstract
Probabilistic
models
provide
sound
coherent
foundation
dealing
with
noise
uncertainty
encountered
most
realworld
domains
Bayesian
networks
language
representing
complex
probabilistic
models
compact
natural
Bayesian
network
used
reason
about
attribute
domain
given
observations
thus
used
variety
tasks
including
prediction
explanation
decision
making
probabilistic
semantics
also
gives
strong
foundation
task
learning
models
from
data
Techniques
currently
exist
learning
both
structure
parameters
dealing
with
missing
data
hidden
variables
discovering
causal
structure
main
limitations
Bayesian
networks
that
they
represent
world
terms
fixed
“attributes”
Like
propositional
logic
they
incapable
reasoning
explicitly
about
entities
thus
cannot
represent
models
over
domains
where
entities
relations
between
them
fixed
advance
consequence
Bayesian
networks
limited
their
ability
model
large
complex
domains
Probabilistic
relational
models
language
describing
probabilistic
models
based
significantly
more
expressive
basis
relational
logic
They
allow
domain
represented
terms
entities
their
properties
relations
between
them
These
models
represent
uncertainty
over
properties
entity
representing
probabilistic
dependence
both
other
properties
that
entity
properties
related
entities
They
even
represent
uncertainty
over
relational
structure
itself
Some
techniques
Bayesian

Probabilistic
