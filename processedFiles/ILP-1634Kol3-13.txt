learning
models
from
data
techniques
currently
exist
learning

parameters
dealing
with
missing

hidden
variables
discovering
causal
structure
main
limitations
bayesian
networks
that
they
represent
world
terms
fixed
attributes
like
propositional
logic
they
incapable
reasoning
explicitly
about
entities
thus
cannot
represent
models
over
domains
where
entities
relations
between
them
fixed
advance
consequence
bayesian
networks
limited
their
ability
model
large
complex
domains
probabilistic
relational
models
language
describing
probabilistic
models
based
significantly
more
expressive
basis
relational
logic
they
allow
domain
represented
terms
entities
their
properties
relations
between
them
these
models
represent
uncertainty
over
properties
entity
representing
probabilistic
dependence

they
even
represent
