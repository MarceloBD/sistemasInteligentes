Abstract
crucial
problem
rule­based
machine
translation
acquisition
translation
knowledge
Many
studies
have
been
conducted
automatic
acquisition
past
they
require
great
deal
annotated
examples
this
paper
describe
semi­automatic
acquisition
from
translation
examples
Japanese­Chinese
environment
Whenever
necessary
process
interacts
with
user
linguist
will
provides
additional

constraints
generalizing
translation
examples
semi­-automatic
approach
more
efficient
sense
that
less
examples
required
than
automatic
approaches
Once
acquired
knowledge
integrated
with
system
observe
improvement
