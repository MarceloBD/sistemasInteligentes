Abstract
A crucial problem in rule­based machine translation is the acquisition of translation knowledge. Many
studies have been conducted for automatic acquisition in the past, but they require a great deal of
annotated examples. In this paper, we describe a semi­automatic acquisition from translation examples in
Japanese­Chinese environment. Whenever necessary, the process interacts with a user (a linguist) who
will provides additional information and constraints for generalizing the translation examples. The semi­-automatic 
approach is more efficient in the sense that less examples are required than automatic
approaches. Once the acquired knowledge is integrated with an MT system, we observe an improvement
in translation quality.
