Abstract
This
paper
shows
that
adaptation

Furthermore
type

used
systems
performing
specific
tasks
quite
regular

These
conclusions
reached
reviewing
forty-two
systems
classifying
them
according
three
taxonomies
adaptation-relevant
taxonomy

then
show
different
systems
cluster
with

suggested
this
paper
useful
Moreover
this
paper
help
focus
initial
stages
systems

suggesting
basis
existing
work
what
types
