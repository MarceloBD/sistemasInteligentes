recently
proposed
method
evaluating
performance
retrieval

without

judgments
they
demonstrated
that
system
evaluations
produced
their
methodology
correlated
with
actual
evaluations
using

this
work
propose
explanation
this
phenomenon
devise
simple
measure
quantifying
similarity
retrieval
systems
assessing
similarity
their
retrieved
results
then
given
collection
retrieval
systems
their
retrieved
results
this
measure
assess
average
similarity
system
other
systems
collection
demonstrate
that
evaluating
retrieval
systems
according
average
similarity
yields
results
quite
similar
methodology
proposed

further
demonstrate
that
these
techniques
fact
highly
correlated
