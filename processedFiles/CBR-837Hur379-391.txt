Abstract
This
paper
describes
application
case-based
reasoning
techniques
complex
domain
namely
mesh
specification
finite
element
analysis
case-base
provides
high-level
store
information
extracted
through
CPU-intensive
numerical
error
analysis
previously
solved
problems
making
available
mesh
specification
before
simulation
similar
problems
Using
this
information
near-to-optimum
mesh
specified
input
simulation
engine
avoiding
time-consuming
computation
during
simulation
paper
describes
system
case
representation
organisation
retrieval
compares
approach
with
more
usual
rule-based
approaches
this
