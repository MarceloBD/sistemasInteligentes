Abstract
construct

minimal
optimal
refinement
operator
hypotheses
spaces
bounded
below
most
specific
clause
subject
syntactical

form
input/output
variable
declarations
like
Progol
Since
unfortunately
such
optimal
refinement
operators
exist
settle
weaker
form
optimality
introduce
associated
weaker
form
subsumption
which
exactly
captures
first
incompleteness
Progol’s
refinement
operator
argue
that

second
type
incompleteness
Progol
subtle
interactions
between
requirements
non-redundancy
completeness
variable
dependencies
more
problematic
since
sometimes
lead
unpredictable
results
remove
this
incompleteness
constructing
sequence
increasingly
more
complex
refinement
operators
which
eventually
produces
