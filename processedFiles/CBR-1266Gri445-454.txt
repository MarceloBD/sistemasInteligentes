Abstract
VS-CBR
simple
instance-based
learning
algorithm
that
adjusts
weighted
similarity
measure
well
collecting
cases
This
paper
presents
‘PAC’
analysis
VS-CBR
motivated
learning
framework
which
demonstrates
main
ideas
relevant
study
instance-based
learners
Firstly
hypothesis
spaces
learner
different
target
concepts
compared
predict
difficulty
target
concepts
learner
Secondly
helpful
consider
‘constituent
parts’
instance-based
learner
explore
separately
many
examples
needed
infer
good
similarity
measure
many
examples
needed
case
base
Applying
these
approaches
show
that
VS-CBR
learns
quickly
most
variables
representation

target
concept
more
slowly
there
more
