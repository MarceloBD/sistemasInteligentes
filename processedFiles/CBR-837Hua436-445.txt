Summary
building
design
task
viewed
according
many
different
abstractions
example
architect
views
building
collection
spaces
with
particular
properties
while
civil
engineer
might
consider
structure
made
load-bearing
elements
order
produce
workable
design
important
able
combine
these
different
viewpoints
Difficulties
associated
with
combining
viewpoints
lead
what
term
integration
problem
case-based
design
methodology
presented
this
paper
provides
opportunity
model
intentions
several
professions
trades
using
cases
previous
good
designs
Therefore
provides
pre-formulated
solutions
integration
problems
describe
prototype
design
system
CADRE
which
applies
several
examples
