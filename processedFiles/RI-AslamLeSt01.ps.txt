Abstract
this
paper
present
approach
clustering
data
concentrate
case
where
only
available
information
about
data
similarity

expected
handle
very
noisy
data
make
assumptions
about
size
number
clusters
only

make
about
data
itself
that
similarity
measure
average
higher
between
elements
belonging
same
cluster
than
between
elements
belonging
different
clusters
algorithm
relies
very
simple
operations
running
