Abstract
This
paper
describes
technique
integrating
case-based
reasoning
with
model-based
reasoning
predict
behavior
biological
systems
characterized
both
incomplete
models
insufficient
empirical
data
accurate
induction
This
technique
implemented
GARMA
system
rangeland
pest
management
advising
CARMA’s
ability
predict
forage
consumption
judgments
expert
entomologists
empirically
compared
that
CARMA’s
case-based
model-based
components
isolation
This
evaluation
confirmed
hypothesis
that
integrating
model-based
case-based
reasoning
through
model-based
adaptation
lead
more
accurate
predictions
than
either
technique
individually
