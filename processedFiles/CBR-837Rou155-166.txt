Abstract
This
article
deals
with
prediction
processes
Research
work
this
topic
considers
some
well
known
processes
Their
prediction
based
model
which
takes
precisely
into
account
influence

involved
modification
their
state
Such
models
conceivable
here
point
indeed
some
processes
that
human
beings
control
little
like
forest
fires
which
subject
system
presented
here
reasoning
that
uses
relies
cases
consider
indeed
that
processes
behaved
same
during
certain
interval
then
their
behaviours
very
likely
similar

Because
complexity
handled
processes
points
view
have
been
introduced
Their
consideration
requires
