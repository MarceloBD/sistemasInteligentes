abstract
this
paper
describes
bootstrapping
algorithm
called
basilisk
that
learns
high
quality
semantic
lexicons
multiple
categories
basilisk
begins
with
unannotated
corpus
seed
words
each
semantic
category
which
then
bootstrapped
learn
words
each
category
basilisk
hypothesizes
semantic
class
word
based
collective
information
over
large
body
extraction
pattern
contexts
evaluate
basilisk
semantic
categories
semantic
lexicons
produced
basilisk
have
higher
precision
than
those
produced
previous
techniques
with
several
categories
showing
substantial
improvement
