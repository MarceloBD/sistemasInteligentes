Abstract
Developing
countries
still
suffer
lack
adequate
skilled
medical
health
personnel
poor
infrastructure
Expert
systems
have
been
identified
potential
tools
addressing
some
aspects
these
problems
particular
most
earlier
researchers
investigated
possibility
incorporating
diagnostic-support
applications
medical
work
place
They
using
expert
systems
that
were
built
around
representations
such
production
rules
frames
scripts
semantic
networks
this
paper
report
different
approach
given

MERSY
case-based
reasoning
paradigm
with
some
underlying
domain
model
This
system
therefore
gets
around
limitations
traditional
expert
systems
that
related
knowledge
representation
acquisition
work
also
emphasizes
high
level
physical
portability
hence
relocation
expertise
on-going
