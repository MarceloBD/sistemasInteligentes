Abstract
contributions
sketched
first
contribution
shows
that
special
case
relational
learning
transformed
into
attribute-value
learning
However
much
more
tractable
stick
relational
representation
than
apply
sketched
transformation
This
provides
sound
theoretical
justification
inductive
logic
programming
second
contribution
show
existing
attribute-value
learning
techniques
systems
upgraded
towards
inductive
logic
programming
using
‘Leuven’
methodology
illustrate
using
Claudien
Tilde
Warmr
MacCent
systems
