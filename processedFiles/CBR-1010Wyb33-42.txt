Abstract

This paper presents the PROFIL system, a Decision Support Tool for the Design of
metallic sections production. The PROFIL system uses a Case-Based Reasoning approach
for the selection of pertinent former designs.
Production of metallic sections is done by a succession of forming operations. The design
task is composed of two parts : selection and scheduling of operations and assessment of
forming tools geometry.
The PROFIL system also provides support to production technicians, to input process
parameters and control measurements as part of cases, and to adjust settings during pre-production trials.
Selection of cases is made by following two orthogonal points of view, on similarity and
quality of produced parts. Similarity is based on selection of relevant dimensions of the
section, while quality is based on selection of potential defects. Each dimension or defect
is associated to an evaluation function which uses a fuzzy logic approach. To improve
ergonomy, relevant cases are displayed in a two-dimension space : similitude/quality.
Implementation of the system has been done on a computer workstation, using a
commercial DBMS, in order to cope with industrial requirements.
The PROFIL system is operational in the industrial site and provides support to designers
and process technicians.
