Abstract
Shinohara
Arimura
Krishna
have
shown
learnability
limit
minimal
models
classes
logic
programs
from
positive
only
data
most
cases
these
results
involve
logic
programs
which
“size”
head
yields
bound
size
body
literals
However
when
local
variables
present
such
bound
body
literal
size
cannot
directly
ensured
above
authors
achieve
such
restriction
using
technical
notions
like
mode
linear
inequalities
present
paper
develops
conceptually
clean
framework
where
behavior
local
variables
controlled
nonlocal
ones
shown
that
certain
classes
logic
programs
learnablity
from
positive
data
equivalent
limiting
identification
bounds
number
clauses
number
local
variables
This
reduces
learning
problem
finding
integers
This
cleaner
framework
generalizes
known
results
establishes
learnability
classes
