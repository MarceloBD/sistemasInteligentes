Abstract
consider
learnability

logic
programs
presence
noise
assuming
that
label
each
example
reversed
with
fixed
probability
review
polynomial
learnability
nonrecursive
determinate
constant-depth
Horn
clauses
presence
such
noise
This
result
extended
analogous
class
recursive
logic
programs
that
consist
recursive
clause
base
case

ground
background
knowledge
Also
show
that
arbitrary
nonrecursive
Horn
clauses
with
forest
background
knowledge
remain
polynomially
learnable
presence
noise
point
that
sample
size
decreased
using
dependencies
among
literals
