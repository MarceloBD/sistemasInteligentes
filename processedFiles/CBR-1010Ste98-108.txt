Abstract
Nowadays
automotive
industry
face
major
challenges
First
products
must
meet
continually
increasing
government
requirements
fuel
economy
exhaust
emission
Second
market
demands

automobile’s
combustion
system
determines

specifically
Case-based
Reasoning
transform
traditional
database
containing
both
geometry
air-motion
data
into
called
experience
memory

different
learning
algorithms
then
extracted
