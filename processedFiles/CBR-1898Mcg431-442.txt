Abstract
Automatically
generating
high-quality
routes
using
real
data
difficult
number
reasons
Real
maps
rarely
contain
sort
information
that
useful
constructing
high
quality
routes
addition
notion
“route
quality”
difficult
define
likely
change
from
person
person
this
sense
automatic
construction
high-quality
routes
that
match
preferences
individuals
example
weak-theory
problem
therefore
well
suited
case-based
approach
this
paper
describe
evaluate
case-based
route
planning
system
that
capable
efficiently
generating
routes
that
reflect
implicit
preferences
