however
most

rely
domainspecific

which
represents
substantial
knowledgeengineering
bottleneck
have
developed
system
called
autoslog
that
addresses
knowledgeengineering
bottleneck
task
called
information
extraction
autoslog
automatically

given
appropriate

have
used
autoslog
create

that
required
approximately
personhours
build
this
paper
describe
experiments
with
autoslog
additional
domains

compare

autoslog
across
three
domains
discuss
lessons
learned
about

this
approach
present
results
from
experiments
which
demonstrate
that
