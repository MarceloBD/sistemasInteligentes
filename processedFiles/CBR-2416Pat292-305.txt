Abstract
this
paper
present
three
techniques
knowledge
discovery
case-based
reasoning
first
techniques
D-HS
D-HS+SR
concerned
with
discovery
similarity
knowledge
operate
uncompacted
case-base
while
third
technique
D-HS+PSR
concerned
with
discovery
both
similarity
case
knowledge
operates
compacted
case-base
three
techniques
provide
very
efficient
competent
means
similarity
determination
which
empirically
shown
times
faster
than
k-NN
without

D-HS+PSR
proposes
novel
approach
automatically
engineering
compact
case-bases
with
minimal

system
compared
other
approaches
such
case
deletion/addition
Additionally
approach
provides
means
automatically
reducing
