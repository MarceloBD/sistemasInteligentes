Abstract
Many
today’s
systems
passive
nature
they
require
human
users
activate
them
manually
provide
information
about
incoming
problem
explicitly
this
paper
present
integrated
system
that
combines
system
with
active
database
system
Active
databases
with
support
active
rules

monitoring
event
handling
action
execution
automatic
manner
combined
ActiveCBR
system
consists

transformed
into
feature-value
pairs
required
subsystem
layered
architecture
separates
case-based
reasoning
from
complicated
rule-based
reasoning
improves
traditional
passive
system
with
active
property
This
paper
