Abstract
Locomotives
like
many
modem
complex
machines
equipped
with
capability
generate
on-board
fault
messages
indicating
presence
anomalous
conditions
Such
messages
tend
generate
large
quantities
difficult
time
consuming
interpret
manually
This
paper
presents
design
development
case-based
reasoning
system
diagnosing
locomotive
faults
using
such
fault
messages
input
process
using
torical
repair
data
expert
input
case
generation
validation
described
algorithm

along
with
some
results
