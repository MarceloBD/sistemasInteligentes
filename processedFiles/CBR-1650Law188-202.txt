Abstract
Memory-based
reasoning
systems
class
reasoners
that
derive
solutions
problems
based
past
experiences
Such
reasoners
long-term
memory
knowledge
base
these
past
experiences
which
represented
such
things
specific
events
cases
plans
scripts
This
paper
describes
Unified
Long-Term
Memory
ULTM
system
which
dynamic
conceptual
memory
that
designed
general
capable
simultaneously
supporting
multiple
intentional
reasoning
systems
Through
unique
mixture
content-independent
domain-specific
mechanisms
ULTM
able
flexibly
provide
reasoners
accurate
timely
storage
recall
episodic
memory
structures
addition
ULTM
provides
support
recognizing
opportunities
satisfy
suspended
goals
allowing
reasoning
systems
better
cope
with
unpredictability
dynamic
real-world
domains
helping
them
take
advantage
unexpected
events
