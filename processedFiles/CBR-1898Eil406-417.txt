Abstract
delivery
robot
navigating
real
world
contending
with
multiple
goals
priorities
benefits
from
combining
deliberative
reactive
planning
Deliberative
planners
anticipate
optimize
actions
manage
multiple
goals
once
Reactive
planners
respond
flexibly
moment-to-moment
changing
world
based
incomplete
flawed
knowledge
This
project
proposes
using
case-based
reasoning
fully
integrate
high-level
low-level
planning
techniques
along
with
other
reasoning
tasks
system
resulting
robot
allows
case
selection
mediate
between
methods
addition
robot
learns
recording
reactive
behaviors
storing
plans
creates
introspective
learning
retrieval
features
