There

recommender
systems
offer
more
diverse
choice
alternatives
than
possible
simply
retrieving
cases
that
most

query
Recent
research
shown
that
major
gains
recommendation
diversity
often
achieved
expense
relatively
small
reductions
similarity
However
there
many
domains
which
acceptable
sacrifice
similarity
interest
diversity
address
this
problem
examine
conditions
which
similarity
increased
without

diversity
present
approach
retrieval
which
designed
deliver
such
similarity-preserving
increases
diversity
when
possible
also
present
more
widely
applicable
approach
increasing
diversity
which
requirement
that
similarity
fully
preserved
relaxed
allow
some
