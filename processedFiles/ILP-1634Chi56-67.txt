Abstract
this
paper
present
method
based
nonmonotonic
learning
where
Inductive
Logic
Programming
algorithm
used

apply
method
acquire
graphic
design
knowledge
Acquiring
design
knowledge
challenging
task
because
such
knowledge
complex
vast
thus
focus
principles
layout
constraints
that
layouts
must
satisfy
realize
automatic
layout
generation
Although
have
negative
examples
this
case
generate
them
randomly
considering
that
page
with
just
element
moved
always
wrong
nonmonotonic
learning
method
introduces
predicate
exceptions
method
algorithm
executed
twice
exchanging
positive
negative
examples
From
experiments
using
magazine
advertisements
obtained
rules
characterizing
good
layouts
containing
relationships
between
elements
Moreover
experiments
show
that
method
learn
more
accurate
rules
than
normal
