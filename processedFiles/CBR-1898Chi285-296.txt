abstract
this
paper
proposes
methodology
maintaining
case
based
reasoning
systems
using
fuzzy
decision
tree
induction
machine
learning
technique
methodology
mainly
based
idea
that
large
case
library
transformed
small
case
library
together
with
group
adaptation
rules
which
generated
fuzzy
decision
trees
firstly
approach
learning
feature
weights
automatically
used
evaluate
importance
different
features
given
case
base
secondly
clustering
cases
will
carried
identify
different
concepts
case
base
using
acquired
feature
knowledge
thirdly
adaptation
rules
will
mined
each
concept
using
fuzzy
decision
trees
finally
selection
strategy
based
concepts
coverage
reachability
used
select
representative
cases
effectiveness
method
