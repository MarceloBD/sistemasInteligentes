ABSTRACT
Advances
digital
storage
technology
wide
digital
audio
compression
standards
like
MPEG
have
made
possible
creation
large
archives
audio
material
order
work
efficiently
with
these
large
archives
much
more
structure
than
what
currently
available
needed
creation
necessary
text
indices
difficult
fully
automate
However
significant
amounts
user
time
saved
having
computer
assist
user
during
annotation
process
this
paper
describe
prototype
audio
browsing
tool
that
used
perform
user
experiments
semi­automatic
audio
segmentation
annotation
addition
typical
sound­editor
functionality
system
automatically
suggest
time
lines
that
user
edit
annotate
examine
effect
that
this
automatically
suggested
segmentation

about

Finally
discuss
