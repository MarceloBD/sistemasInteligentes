This
paper
describes
memory-based
planning
system
memory
constitutes
collection

skeletons
Each
skeleton
embodies

development
process
guided
secondary
memory
which
organizes
properties
ingredients
into
inheritance
hierarchy
simple
indexing
hierarchy
allows
access
each
skeleton
which
quite
distinct
captures
whole
