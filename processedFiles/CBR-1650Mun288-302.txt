Abstract
This
paper
describes
HICAP
general-purpose
interactive
case-based
plan
authoring
architecture
that
applied
decision
support
tasks
yield
hierarchical
course
action
integrates
hierarchical
task
editor
with
conversational
case-based
planner
HICAP
maintains
both
task
hierarchy
representing
guidelines
that
constrain
final
plan
hierarchical
social
organization
responsible
these
tasks
also
supports
bookkeeping
which
crucial
real-world
large-scale
planning
tasks
selecting
tasks
corresponding
hierarchy’s
leaf
nodes
users
activate
conversational
case-based
planner
interactively
refine
guideline
tasks
into
concrete
plan
Thus
HICAP
used
generate
context
sensitive
plans
should
useful
assisting
with
planning
complex
tasks
such
noncombatant
evacuation
operations
describe
experiment
with
highly
detailed
military
simulator
investigate
this
claim
results
show
that
plans
generated
HICAP
were
superior
those
generated
alternative
approaches
