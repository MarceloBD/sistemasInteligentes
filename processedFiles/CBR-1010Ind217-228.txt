Abstract
regression
problem
approximate
function
from
sample
values
Decision
trees
decision
rules
achieve
this
task
finding
regions
with
constant
function
values
While
recursive
partitioning
methods
strong
dynamic
feature
selection
explanatory
capabilities
essential
weakness
these
methods
approximation
region
constant
value
propose
method
that
relies
searching
similar
cases
boost
performance
method
preserves
strengths
partitioning
schemes
while
compensating
weaknesses
that
introduced
with
constant-value
regions
method
relies
searching
most
relevant
cases
using
rule-based
system
then
using
these
cases
determining
function
value
Experimental
results
demonstrate
that
method
often
yield
superior
regression
performance
