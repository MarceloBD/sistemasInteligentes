Abstract
present
paper
discusses
generalization
operator
based
A-subsumption
ordering
between
Horn
clauses
introduced
author
elsewhere
been
shown
that
A-subsumption
strictly
stronger
than
O-subsumption
local
equivalent
generalized
subsumption
With
some
language
restrictions
decidable
possesses
some
other
useful
properties
Most
importantly
allows
defining
non-trivial
upper
bound
A-subsumption
generalization
hierarchy
without
negative
examples
Consequently
this
allows
solving
version
task
with
positive-only
examples
