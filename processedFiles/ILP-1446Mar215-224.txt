abstract
present
paper
discusses
generalization
operator
based
subsumption
ordering
between
horn
clauses
introduced
author
elsewhere
been
shown
that
subsumption
strictly
stronger
than
subsumption
local
equivalent
generalized
subsumption
with
some
language
restrictions
decidable
possesses
some
other
useful
properties
most
importantly
allows
defining
trivial
upper
bound
subsumption
generalization
hierarchy
without
negative
examples
consequently
this
allows
solving
version
task
with
positive
only
examples
