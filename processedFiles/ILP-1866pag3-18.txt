Abstract
Inductive
logic
programming
built
foundation
laid
research
other
areas
computational
logic
spite
this
strong
foundation
years
faces
number
challenges
brought
exciting
application
opportunities
purpose
this
paper
interest
researchers
from
other
areas
computational
logic
contributing
their
special
skill
sets
help
meet
these
challenges
paper
presents
five
future
research
directions
points
initial
approaches
results
where
they
exist
hoped
that
paper
will
motivate
researchers
from
throughout
computational
logic
invest
some
time
into
“doing”
