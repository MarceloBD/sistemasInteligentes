Abstract
Early
work
case
based
reasoning
reported
literature
shows
importance
case
base
maintenance
successful
practical
systems
Different
criteria
maintenance
task
have
been
used
more
than
half
century
this
paper
present
different
sort
techniques
case
base
maintenance
sort
techniques
proposed
based
same
principle
Rough
Sets
competence
model
First
present
sort
reduction
techniques
based
deletion
cases
Next
present
sort
techniques
that
build
reduced
competent
case
memories
based
original
ones
main
purpose
these
methods
maintain
competence
reduce
much
possible
size
Experiments
using
different
domains
most
them
from
repository
show
that
reduction
techniques
maintain
competence
obtained
original
case
memory
results
analysed
with
those
obtained
using
well-known
reduction
techniques
