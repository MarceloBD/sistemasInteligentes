Abstract
this
paper
consider
learning
first-order
Horn
programs
from
entailment
particular
show
that
subclass
first-order
acyclic
Horn
programs
with
constant
arity
exactly
learnable
from
equivalence
entailment
membership
queries
provided
allows
polynomial-time
subsumption
procedure
satisfies
some
closure
conditions
consequence
this
that
first-order
acyclic
determinate
Horn
programs
with
