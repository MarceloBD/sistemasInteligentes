ABSTRACT
Indexing
content­based

necessary
handle
large
amounts
audio
multimedia
data
that

Since
manual
indexing
using
ex­isting
audio
editors
extremely
time
consuming
number
au­tomatic
content
analysis
systems
have
been
proposed
Most
these
systems
rely
speech
recognition
techniques
create
text
indices
other
hand
very
systems
have
been
proposed
automatic
indexing
music
general
audio
Typically
these
systems
rely
classification
similarity­retrieval
techniques
work
restricted
audio
domains
somewhat
different
more
general

fast
indexing
arbitrary
audio
data
segmentation
based
multi­ple
temporal

combined
with
automatic
semi­automatic

this
paper
general

were
performed

proposed
methodology
compare

Finally
