abstract
there
have
been
several
efforts
create
real
maps
computer
applications
that
automatically
find
good
routes
general
online
representations
include
information
that
relevant
purpose
generating
good
realistic
routes
including
example
traffic
patterns
construction
number
lanes
furthermore
notion
good
route
dependent
variety
factors
such
time
also
user
dependent
this
motivation
leads
work
accumulation
reuse
previously
traversed
routes
cases
this
paper
demonstrate
route
planning
method
which
retrieves
reuses
multiple
past
routing
cases
that
collectively
form
good
basis
generating
routing
plan
briefly
present
similarity
metric
retrieving
similar
routes
metric
effectively
takes
into
account
geometric
continuous
valued
characteristics
city
then
present
replay
mechanism
planner
produces
route
plan
analogizing
from
retrieved
similar
past
routes
discuss
particular
strategy
used
merge
cases
generate
route
illustrative
examples
show
some
empirical
