Abstract
Most
systems
employ
covering
algorithm
whereby
hypotheses
constructed
iteratively
clause
clause
Typically
covering
algorithm
greedy
sense
that
each
iteration
adds
best
clause
according
some
local
evaluation
criterion
Some
typical
problems
covering
algorithm
unnecessarily
long
hypotheses
difficulties
handling
recursion
difficulties
learning
multiple
predicates
This
paper
investigates
non-covering
approach
implemented
Prolog
program
called
HYPER
whose
goals
were
intensional
background
knowledge
handle
recursion
well
enable
multi-predicate
learning
Experimental
results
this
paper
appear
surprising
view
very
high
combinatorial
complexity
search
space
associated
with
non-covering
approach
