Abstract
Many
case-based
reasoning
algorithms
retrieve
cases
using
derivative
k-nearest
neighbor
k-NN
classifier
whose
similarity
function
sensitive
irrelevant
interacting
noisy
features
Many
proposed
methods
reducing
this
sensitivity
parameterize
k-NN’s
similarity
function
with
feature
weights
focus
methods
that
automatically
assign
weight
settings
using
little
domain-specific
knowledge
goal
predict
relative
capabilities
these
methods
specific
dataset
characteristics
introduce
five-dimensional
framework
that
categorizes
automated
weight-setting
methods
empirically
compare
methods
along
these
dimensions
summarize
results
with
four
hypotheses
describe
additional
evidence
that
supports
them
investigation
revealed
that
most
methods
correctly
assign
weights
completely
irrelevant
features
methods
that
performance
feedback
demonstrate
three
advantages
over
other
methods
they
require
less
pre-processing
better
tolerate
interacting
features
increase
learning
rate
