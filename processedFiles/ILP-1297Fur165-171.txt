Abstract
This
paper
describes
bottom-up
algorithm
called
which
induces
recursive
programs
with
more
recursive
clauses
from
examples
analyzes
saturations
using
path
structures
which
express
streams
terms
processed
predicates
originally
introduced
Identam-Almquist
introduce

structures
Recursive
clauses
expressed
difference
among
path
structures
paper
also
