abstract
this
paper
discusses
online
poweraware
routing
large
wireless
adhoc
networks
especially
sensor
networks
applications
where
message
sequence
known
seek
optimize
lifetime
network
show
that
online
poweraware
routing
does
have
constant
competitive
ratio
line
optimal
algorithm
develop
approximation
algorithm
called
maxmin
zpmin
that
good
empirical
competitive
ratio
ensure
scalability
introduce
second
online
algorithm
poweraware
routing
this
hierarchical
algorithm
called
zonebased
routing
experiments
show
that
performance
quite
good
finally
describe
distributed
version
this
algorithm
that
does
depend
centralization
