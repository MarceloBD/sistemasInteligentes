problem
classification
using
first
order
hypotheses
this
paper
proposes
enhancement
classification
based
naive
bayesian
scheme
that
able
overcome
conditional
independence
assumption
several
experiments
involving
some
artificial
real
world
both
propositional
relational
domains
were
conducted
results
indicate
that
classification
performance
propositional
learners
reached
when
richer
first

knowledge
representation
mandatory
this
holds
also
domains
where
such
representation
more
convenient
framework
also
benefit
from
hypotheses
describing
negative
information
such
case
classification
becomes
more
