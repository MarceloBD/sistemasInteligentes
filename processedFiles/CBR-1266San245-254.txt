abstract
case
based
reasoning
involves
reasoning
from
cases
specific
pieces
experience
reasoners
anothers
that
used
solve
problems
term
graph
structured
representations
that
capable
expressing
relations
between
objects
case
allow
relations
used
vary
from
case
case
allow
possible
relations
expanded
necessary
describe
cases
such
representations
implemented
example
semantic
networks
lists
concrete
propositions
some
logic
believe
that
graph
structured
representations
offer
significant
advantages
thus
investigating
ways
implement
such
representations
efficiently
make
case
based
argument
using
examples
from
systems
chiron
caper
show
graph
structured
representation
supports
different
kinds
case
based
planning
different
domains
discuss
costs
associated
with
graph
structured
representations
describe
approach
reducing
those
costs
