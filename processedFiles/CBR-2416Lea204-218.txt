Abstract
Case-based
reasoning
systems
solve
problems
retrieving
stored

cases
adapting
their
solutions

Traditionally
systems
draw
their
cases
from
single
local
case-base
tailored

However
when
system’s

beneficial
supplement
local
case-base
with
cases
drawn
from
external
case-bases
related
tasks
Effective
external

strategies
multi-case-base

MCBR

case-base
performing
cross-case-base
adaptation
