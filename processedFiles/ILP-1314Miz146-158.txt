Abstract
This
paper
provides
empirical
study
Inductive
Logic
Programming
method
through
application
classifying
ocular
fundus
images
glaucoma
diagnosis
issues
this
study
only
dealing
with
low-level
measurement
data
such
image
also
producing
diagnostic
rules
that
readable
comprehensive
interactions
medical
experts
this
purpose
develop
constraint-directed
system
that
handles
both
symbolic
numerical
data
produce
Horn
clauses
with
numerical
constraints
Furthermore
provide
with
“sequential”
learning
facility
where
repeatedly
generates
single
best
rule
which
becomes
background
knowledge
next
learning
phase
Since
learning
target
this
application
abnormality
each
segment
image
generated
rules
represent
relationships
between
abnormal
segments
Since
such
relationships
interpreted
qualitative
rules
used
diagnostic
rules
directly
present
method
provides
automatic
construction
knowledge
base
from
expert’s
accumulated
diagnostic
experience
Furthermore
experimental
result
shows
that
induced
rules
have
high
statistical
performance
present
study
indicates
