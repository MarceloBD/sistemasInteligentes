Abstract
Defining
similarity
measures
crucial
task
when
developing
applications
Particularly
when
employing
utility-based
similarity
measures
rather
than
pure
distance-based
measures
confronted
with
difficult
knowledge
engineering
task
this
paper
point
some
problems
state-of-the-art
procedure
defining
similarity
measures
overcome
these
problems
propose
alternative
strategy
acquire
necessary
domain
knowledge
based
Machine
Learning
approach
show
feasibility
this
strategy
several
application
scenarios
discussed
some
results
experimental
evaluation
these
scenarios
presented
