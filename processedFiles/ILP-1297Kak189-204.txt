Abstract
propose
this
paper
approach
learning
predicate
definitions
from
examples
from
initial
theory
particularity
this
approach
consists
inventing
both
predicate
symbol
specification
this
predicate
most
steps
learning
specifications
that
built
incomplete
imprecise
what
modelized
introducing
notion
o-interpretation
learning
task
some
invented
predicates
removed
unfolding
techniques
remaining
predicates
either
enable
simplify
program
defined
recursive
programs
second
case
program
could
have
been
learned
without
inventing
these
predicates
method
been
implemented
system
called
SPILP
which
been
successfully
tested
inventing
predicates
which
simplify
learned
programs
well
inventing
recursively
defined
predicates
point
that
introduction
o-interpretations
gives
general
framework
dealing
with
imprecise
specifications
that
SPILP
work
even
when
target
concepts
also
incompletely
defined
o-interpretations
