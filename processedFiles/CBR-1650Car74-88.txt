Abstract
Most
traditional
systems
passive
nature
adopting
advisor
role
which
user
manually
consults
system
this
paper
propose
system
architecture
algorithm
transforming
passive
interactive
system
into
active
autonomous
system
approach
based
idea
that
cases
system
used
model
hypotheses
situation
assessment
application
where
case
attributes
considered
questions
information
tasks
performed
multiple
information
sources
Under
this
model
system
continually
generate
tasks
that
planned
executed
based
information
sources
such
databases
Internet
user
herself
advantage
system
that
majority
trivial
repeated
questions
information
sources
done
autonomously
through
information
gathering
techniques
human
users
only
asked
small
number
necessary
questions
system
demonstrate
application
approach
equipment
diagnosis
domain
show
that
system
integrates
retrieval
with
hierarchical
