abstract
case
combination
difficult
problem
case
based
reasoning
cases
often
exhibit
conflicts
when
merged
together
previous
work
formalized
case
combination
representing
each
case
constraint
satisfaction
problem
used
minimum
conflicts
algorithm
systematically
synthesize
global
solution
however
also
found
instances
problem
which
minimum
conflicts
algorithm
does
perform
case
combination
efficiently
this
paper
describe
those
situations
which
initially
retrieved
cases
easily
adaptable
propose
method
which
improve
case
adaptability
with
genetic
algorithm
introduce
fitness
function
that
maintains
much
retrieved
case
information
possible
while
also
perturbing
solution
allow
subsequent
case
combination
proceed
more
efficiently
