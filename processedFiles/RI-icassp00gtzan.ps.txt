ABSTRACT
There
huge
amount
audio
data
available
that
compressed
using
MPEG
audio
compression
standard
Sound
analysis
based
computation
short
time
feature
vectors
that
describe
instantaneous
spectral
con­tent
sound
interesting
possibility
calcu­lation
features
during
decompression
process
Since
bulk
feature
calculation
performed
during
encoding
stage
this
process
significant
performance
advantage
available
data
compressed
Combining
decoding
analysis
stage
also
very
important
audio
streaming
applications
this
paper
describe
calculation
features
directly
from
MPEG
audio
compressed
data
basic
processes
analyzing
sound
segmentation
classification
illustrate
effectiveness
calcu­lated
features
have
implemented
case
studies
general
audio
segmentation
algorithm
Music/Speech
classifier
Experimental
data
provided
show
that
results
obtained
comparable
with
sound
analysis
algo­rithms
working
directly
with
audio
