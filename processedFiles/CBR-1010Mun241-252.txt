Abstract
Structured
domains
characterized
fact
that
there
intrinsic
dependency
between
certain
elements
domain
Considering
these
dependencies
leads
better
performance
planning
systems
important
factor
determining
relevance
cases
stored
case-base
However
testing
cases
that
meet
these
dependencies
decreases
performance
case-based
planning
other
criterions
need
also
consider
determining
this
relevance
present
domain-independent
architecture
that
explicitly
represents
these
dependencies
that
retrieving
relevant
cases
ensured
without
negatively
affecting
performance
case-based
planning
process
