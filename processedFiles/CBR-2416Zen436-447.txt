Abstract
Ensemble
research
shown
that
aggregated
output
ensemble
predictors
more
accurate
than
single
predictor
This
true
also
lazy
learning
systems
like
Case-Based
Reasoning
k-Nearest-Neighbour
Aggregation
normally
achieved
voting
classification
tasks
averaging
regression
tasks
this
increased
accuracy
comes
cost
interpretability
however
consider
retrieved
cases
explanation
advantages
then
this
lost
ensemble
This
because
large
number
cases
will
have
been
retrieved
ensemble
members
this
paper
present
technique
aggregation
that
obtains
excellent
results
identifies
small
number
cases
explanation
This
approach
might
viewed
transformation
process
whereby
cases
transformed
from
their
feature
based
representation
representation
based
predictions
ensemble
members
This
representation
produces
very
accurate
predictions
allows
small
number
