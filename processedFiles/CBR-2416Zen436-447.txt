abstract
ensemble

shown
that
aggregated
output
ensemble
predictors
more
accurate
than
single

this
true
also
lazy
learning
systems
like
case
based
reasoning
nearest

aggregation
normally
achieved
voting
classification
tasks
averaging
regression
tasks
this
increased
accuracy
comes
cost
interpretability
however
consider
retrieved
cases
explanation
advantages
then
this
lost
ensemble
this
because
large
number

have
been

this
paper
present
technique
aggregation
that
obtains
excellent
results
identifies
small
number

explanation
this
approach
might
viewed
transformation
process
whereby
cases
transformed
from

this
representation
produces
very
accurate
