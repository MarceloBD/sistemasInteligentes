Abstract
This
paper
focuses
upon
content

which
representations
mental
world

placed
case-based
explainers
that
employ
introspective
reasoning
That
case-based
reasoning
system
represent
thinking
about
self
about
states
processes
reasoning
what
level
detail
should
attempt
declaratively
capture
contents
thought
Some
claim
that
mere
mental
primitives
sufficient
represent
utterances
humans
concerning

Alternatively
many
community
have
built
systems
that
record
elaborate
traces
reasoning
keep
track
knowledge
dependencies
inference
encode
much
metaknowledge
concerning

internal
rules
defaults
position
here
that
system
should
able
instead
capture
enough
details
represent
causally
common
reasoning
failure
symptoms
propose
simple
model
expectation-driven
reasoning
derive

reasoning
failures
from

present
declarative
representation

Such
representations
enable
