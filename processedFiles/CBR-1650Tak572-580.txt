Abstract
This
paper
describes
quality
management
system
called
CBQM
Case-Based
Quality
Management
using
case-based
reasoning
mechanism
which
based
cost
expectation
value
cost
expectation
value
calculated
from
objective
subjective

developed
quality
management
system
that
employs
stochastic
method
However
some
cases
this
stochastic-based
system
failed
select
good
cases
Therefore
have
integrated
some
expectation
values
into
case
selection
mechanism
CBQM
expectation
measurement
case
selection
criteria
only
similarity
also
some
expectation
values
unforeseen
malfunctions
occur
inappropriate
design
manufacturing
condition
and/or
unsuitable
usage
similarity
enough
select
useful
cases
from
casebase
That
because
similarity
mainly
based
products
themselves
CBQM
adopts
cost
expectation
value
order
pick
useful
cases
CBQM’s
