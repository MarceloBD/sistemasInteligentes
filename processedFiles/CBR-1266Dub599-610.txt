Abstract
This
paper
attempt
providing
fuzzy
set-based
formalization
case-based
reasoning
proposed
approach
which
does
take
into
account
learning
aspects
case-based
reasoning
assumes
principle
stating
that
“the
more
similar
problem
description
attributes
more
similar
outcome
attributes”
weaker
form
this
principle
also
considered
These
forms
case-based
reasoning
principle
modelled
terms
fuzzy
rules
Then
approximate
reasoning
machinery
taking
advantage
this
principle
enables
apply
information
stored

case-based
reasoning
named
case-based

case-based
inference
