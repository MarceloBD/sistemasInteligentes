Abstract
This
paper
presents
application
Inductive

Backpropagation
Neural

problem
Thai
character
recognition
such
learning
problem
there
exist
several
different
classes
examples
there
different
Thai
characters
Using
examples
constructed
from
character
images
learns
rules
each
which
defines
each
character
However
some
unseen
character
images
especially
noisy
images
exactly
match
learned
rule
they
covered
rule
Therefore
method
approximating
rule
that
best
matches
unseen
data
needed
Here
employ
finding
such
rules
Experimental
results
noisy
data
show
that
accuracy
rules
learned
without
help
comparable
other
methods
Furthermore
combining
with
yields
significant
improvement
surpasses
other
methods
