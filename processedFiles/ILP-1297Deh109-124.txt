Abstract
present

system
MACCENT
which
addresses
novel
task

Clausal

Maximum

method
Bayesian

that

MACCENT
incorporates
clausal
constraints
that

build
existing
maximum-likelihood
approach
maximum

MACCENT

clausal

uses
richer
first-order

format
comparison
with
other
inductive
logic

systems
MACCENT
seems
first
that
explicitly
constructs
conditional

p’(C|I
where
p(C|I
p’(C|I
equals

cases
where
