Abstract
present
approach
learning
hypertext
classifiers
that
combines
statistical
text-learning
method
with
relational
rule
learner
This
approach
well
suited
learning
hypertext
domains
because
statistical
component
allows
characterize
text
terms
word
frequencies
whereas
relational
component
able
describe
neighboring
documents
related
each
other
hyperlinks
that
connect
them
evaluate
approach
applying
tasks
that
involve
learning
definitions
classes
pages
particular
relations
that
exist
between
pairs
pages
locating
particular
class
information
internal
structure
pages
experiments
demonstrate
that
this
approach
able
learn
more
accurate
classifiers
than
either
constituent
methods
alone
