Abstract
present

reasoning
method
aspects
First
applies
novel

weighting
function
assessing
similarities
between
cases
using
this
weighting
function
optimal
case
retrieval
achieved
that
most
relevant
cases
retrieved
from
case
base
Second
method
handles
both
classification
numeric
prediction
tasks
under
mixed
paradigm
rule-based
case-based
reasoning
Before
problem
solving
rule
induction
performed
induce
decision
rules
from
training
data
rules
then
employed
determine
some
parameters
weighting
function
induced
rules
also
used
detect

noise
training
that
noisy
cases
used
case-based
reasoning
classification
tasks
rules
applied
make
decisions
there

between
matched
rules
case-based
reasoning
