Abstract
This
paper
presents
Case-Based
Reasoning
Real-Time
Scheduling
System
CBR-RTS
that
integrates
into
case-based
reasoning
framework
heuristic
search
component
problem
addressed
involves
scheduling
sets
tasks
with
precedence
ready
time
deadline
constraints
CBR-RTS
reuses
solution
known
cases
simplify
solve
problems
When
system
does
have
applicable
cases
tries
find
solution
using
heuristic
search
particularly
interesting
feature
CBR-RTS
learning
ability
problems
solved
heuristic
scheduler
added
case
base
future
reuse
Performed
tests
have
shown
that
small
bases
cases
carefully
chosen
allow
substantially
reduce
time
needed
solve
complex
problems
