Abstract
Collaborative
filtering
systems
make
recommendations
based
accumulation
ratings
many
users
process
case-based
reasoning
flavor
recommendations
generated
looking
behavior
other
users
considered
similar
However
features
associated
with
user
semantically
weak
compared
with
those
used
systems
This
research
examines
multi-dimensional
semantic
ratings
which
system
gets
information
about
reason
behind
preference
Experiments
show
that
metrics
which
semantic
meaning
each
rating
taken
into
account
have
markedly
superior
performance
than
simpler
techniques
