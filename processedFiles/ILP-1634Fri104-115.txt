Abstract
Since
inception
field
inductive
logic
programming
been
centrally
concerned
with
background
knowledge
induction
surprisingly
serious
attempts
have
been
made
account
background
knowledge
refinement
operators
clauses
even
though
such
operators
most
important
prominent
widely-used
devices
field
This
paper
shows
sort
theory
which
encodes
taxonomic
knowledge
built
into
downward
subsumption-based
refinement
operator
clauses
