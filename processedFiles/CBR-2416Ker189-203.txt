Abstract
This
paper
presents
novel
case-based
plan
recognition
system
that
interprets
observations
plan
behavior
using
case
library
past
observations
system
novel
that
represents
plan
sequence
action-state
pairs
rather
than
sequence
actions
preceded
some
initial
state
followed
some
final
goal
state
system
utilizes
unique
abstraction
scheme
represent
indices
into
case
base
paper
examines
evaluates
three
different
methods
prediction
first
method
prediction
without
adaptation
second
predication
with
adaptation
third
prediction
with
heuristics
show
that
first
method
better
than
baseline
random
prediction
that
second
method
improvement
over
first
that
second
third
methods
combined
best
overall
strategy
