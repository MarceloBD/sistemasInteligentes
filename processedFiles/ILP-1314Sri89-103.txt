Abstract
Recently
computer
programs
developed
within
field
Inductive
Logic
Programming
have
received
some
attention
their
ability
construct
restricted
first-order
logic
solutions
using
problem-specific
background
knowledge
Prominent
applications
such
programs
have
been
concerned
with
determining
“structure-activity”
relationships
areas
molecular
biology
chemistry
Typically
task
here
predict
“activity”
compound
like
toxicity
from
chemical
structure
Research
area
shows
that
programs
have
been
restricted
qualitative
predictions
activity
“high”
“low”
When
appropriate
attributes
available
programs
have
been
able
better
performance
standard
quantitative
analysis
techniques
like
linear
regression
However
programs
perform
creditably
when
such
attributes
unavailable
When
both
applicable
programs
usually
slower
than
their
propositional
counterparts
This
paper
examines
programs
obtaining
theories
complete
sample
method
“discovering”
attributes
These
could
then
used
methods
like
linear
regression
thus
allowing
