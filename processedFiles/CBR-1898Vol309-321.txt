some
case
based
reasoning
applications
decision
support
there
number
vague
qualitative
criteria
that
have
taken
into
account
similarity
measure
sometimes
these
criteria
very
hard
acquire
quantify
they
often
conflict
with
main
quality
criterion
that
measured
similarity
function
surprisingly
this
sometimes
true
even
cost
criteria
mostly
believed
quite
quantitative
certain
applications
acceptable
cost
limit
depends
mostly
quality
that
available
thus
cannot
specified
priori
this
paper
discusses
problems
arising
from
this
kind
implicit
criteria
shows
approaches
they
integrated
into
similarity
measure
case
based
reasoning
system
without
need
artificially
quantifying
them
