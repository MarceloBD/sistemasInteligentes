Abstract
important
research
area
field
Inductive
Logic
Programming
concerned
with
predicate
learning
Recently
many
predicate
learners
have
been
developed
whose
task
consists
learning
definition
concept
from
positive
negative
examples
most
them
definition
concept
represented
definite
normal
clauses
variables
that
appear
head
clause
head-variables
universally
quantified
variables
that
appear
only
body
clause
body-variables
existentially
quantified
Some
predicate
learners
described
literature
able
deal
with
such
existential
body-)variables
using
some
language
bias
like
ij-determinacy
However
authors
know
system
able
deal
with
clauses
whose
body
both
existential
universal
body-variables
appear
Moreover
there
exists
generalisation
specialisation
operator
that
handle
such
body-variables
this
paper
first
present
generalisation/specialisation
rules
devoted
deal
with
existential
universal
variables
that
appear
only
body
clauses
then
highlight
some
properties
these
rules
essentially
correctness
completeness
theorems
explicit
type
control
that
could
permit
exploit
practically
these
rules
system
however
give
some
ideas
integrate
them
different
sorts
systems
with
minor
modifications
without
increasing
search
space
greatly
Following
motivation
systems
with
respect
more
classical
machine
learning
ones
important
motivation
these
rules
extend
expressiveness
representation
formalism
clauses
without
Skolem
functions
with
only
existential
body-variables
Moreover
significant
interest
q-operators
presented
this
paper
that
several
existing
systems
adapted
with
some
modifications
process
quantifiers
body
clauses
thus
increase
their
expressiveness
