Abstract
Both
propositional
relational
learning
algorithms
require
good
representation
perform
well
practice
Usually
such
representation
either
engineered
manually
domain
experts
derived
automatically
means
so-called
constructive
induction
Inductive
Logic
Programming
algorithms
somewhat
less
burden
data
engineering
effort
they
allow
structured
relational
representation
background
knowledge
chemical
engineering
domains
common
representational
device
graph-like
structures
so-called
non-determinate
relations
Manually
engineered
features
such
domains
typically
test
count
occurrences
specific
substructures
having
specific
properties
However
representations
containing
non-determinate
relations
pose
serious
efficiency
problem
most
standard
algorithms
Therefore
have
devised
stochastic
algorithm
automatically
derive
features
from
non-determinate
background
knowledge
algorithm
conducts
top-down
search
first-order
clauses
where
each
clause
represents
binary
feature
These
features
used
instead
non-determinate
relations
subsequent
induction
step
contrast
comparable
algorithms
search
class-blind
there
arbitrary
size
restrictions
imposed
candidate
clauses
empirical

chemical
