Abstract
CohenвЂ™s
refinement
rules
provide
flexible
mechanism
introducing
intentional
background
knowledge
system
Whereas
Cohen
used
limited
second
order
theorem
prover
implement
rule
interpreter
extend
method
full
Prolog
interpreter
This
makes
introduction
more
complex
background
knowledge
possible
Although
refinement
rules
have
been
used
generate
literals
general-to-specific
search
show
they
also
used
filters
reduce
number
literals
RLGG
algorithm
Each
literal
constructed
tested
against
refinement
rules
only
admitted
refinement
rule
been
satisfied
