Abstract
Case-based
reasoning
been
applied
with
some
success
complex
planning
design
tasks
such
systems
best
case
retrieved
adapted
solve
particular
target
problem
Often
best
case
that
which
most
easily
adapted
target
problem
overhead
adaptation
generally
very
high
Standard
systems
semantic-similarity
retrieve
cases
assumption
that
most
similar
case
easiest
case
adapt
However
this
assumption
shown
flawed
this
paper
report
novel
retrieval
method
called
adaptation-guided
retrieval
that
sensitive
ease-of-adaptation
cases
context
system
software-design
called
Dйjа
show
through
series
experiments
that
adaptation-guided
retrieval
more
accurate
than
standard
retrieval
techniques
that
scales
well
large
case-bases
that
results
more
efficient
overall
problem-solving
performance

this
method
